                <p class="about__text">The French bulldog is not simply a miniature bulldog. The most notable
                    characteristic is the "bat" ear, which occurs naturally and is never cropped or altered. Also unique
                    to the breed is the skull, which is flat between the ears. The French bulldog is a compact, muscular
                    dog with a flat, short coat. Colors common to the breed include fawn, white and varieties of
                    brindle. The male and female dog weight is 25-27 lbs.</p>

                <p class="history__text-item">In the early 1800s, Normandy lace workers from England set off to find work in
                    France. They took with them smaller bulldogs to be kept on the farms as companions and to chase away
                    the rats. In these northern French farming communities, the popularity of this hardy dog grew
                    quickly. In fact, established bulldog breeders in England were happy to perpetuate this "new" breed
                    by selling their undersized dogs to the French.
                    The dog is widely known as a very fashionable household companion kept by upper class and royalty.
                    One French bulldog, insured for an incredible sum (at that time) of $750, traveled aboard the
                    Titanic. In the late 1800s and early 1900s the French bulldog was considered a dog of high society;
                    the breed still attracts people who appreciate the finer things in life.</p>

                <p class="facts__text-swim">French bulldogs can't swim â€¦ and they can't fly, either. Being in the flat-nosed family, flying on a
                    plane can be life threatening and many airlines have banned all brachycephalic breeds. There are
                    still ways to travel with a Frenchie; owners just need to take some extra precautions before hopping
                    on a flight.</p>
                <p class="facts__text-celebrity">Many celebrities love French bulldogs including John Legend, Madonna, and Lady Gaga. Carrie Fisher's
                    Frenchie Gary became a mini celebrity himself, showing up everywhere the actress went, even the red
                    carpet.</p>
                <p class="facts__text-swim-talk">French bulldogs love to talk, and they definitely aren't afraid to speak their minds. Walter Geoffrey
                    the Frenchie has thousands of subscribers on YouTube for his temper tantrums.</p>
